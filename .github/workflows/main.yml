# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Build webpack project 🚀
        run: |
          rm -rf dist
          yarn install
          yarn build
          echo 'Build finished! 💪'
          git config --global user.email "yann.klein@me.com"
          git config --global user.name "Yann Klein"
          git add .
          git commit -m "homepage deployed"
          git push origin master
          echo 'Deployed like a rockstar 🎸'
          # git co -b gh-pages
          # git push origin gh-pages
          # echo 'Pushed on Github Pages like hero 🦸‍♀️'
